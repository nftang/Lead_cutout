Privacy Policy for Mobile App, “Lead Cutout”

Last Updated: 2025-10-05

Lead Cutout (“the App”) is a free research-oriented mobile application intended for use by the medical physics community to estimate lead cutout factors based on the ratio of TG-61 backscatter factors (BSF) of open cone and cutout aperture. It is strictly not for clinical use (see Disclaimer section below for details).

Summary
We do not collect, store, transmit, share, or sell any personal data. All calculations and user-provided data remain on the device and are discarded when the App is closed. The App does not require any network or internet connectivity and runs totally offline. No prior registration or login is required to use the App. A welcoming dialogue pops up when the App loads and user is provided with an URL link to this Privacy Policy. User has to agree with the Disclaimer here before allowing to proceed to use the App.

Data Collection
Personal Data: Not collected.
Usage / Analytics Data: Not collected.
Crash Logs / Diagnostics: Not collected (no third-party analytics or crash SDKs integrated).
Device Identifiers: Not collected.
Location: Not collected.
Images: Accessed only if you choose to capture or import one; images remain local and are not uploaded to elsewhere by the App.

Camera and Photo Library Access
The App requests permission to:
Use the camera: To allow you to capture an image (e.g., of a cutout or scale QA) for on-device reference during factor estimation.
Access the photo library: To let you optionally import an existing image for the same purpose. For newer operating systems (iOS 14+ and Android 14+), additional permission option of limited access to photo library is enacted and you can restrict access to specific sample of images which can be managed either by the App or via the device settings. Images are processed on-device only. The App does not transmit, analyze off-device, or store them beyond your device’s normal photo storage. You may revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings.

Data Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties. No data leaves your device through the App. Your cutout aperture is only known to the App and the image processed and graphics overlays will not be stored or transferred to elsewhere.


Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed toward children under 13 years of age and contains no features encouraging data submission.

Security
Because the App does not transmit or store user data externally, exposure risk is minimized. Standard platform (iOS/Android) sandboxing applies. Navigation history and app usage are not monitored or shared.

Choices to Users
You may decline camera/photo permissions (core numerical functionality such as open-cone backscatter factors (BSF) table lookup and interpolation remain available if lead cutout images not used). You can uninstall the App to remove all locally stored data.
For accessibility consideration, the App provides on-screen magnification and panning with just a long-press on non-input areas.

Third-Party Services
The App does not integrate advertising networks, analytics services, social plugins, in-app purchase or external data processors.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy for accuracy or compliance. The “Last Updated” date will be revised accordingly. Material changes (e.g., introducing data collection) will be disclosed before they take effect.

Jurisdiction / Compliance Notes
The App is designed to avoid collecting personal data, aligning with minimal obligations under major privacy frameworks (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Should future versions introduce data collection, appropriate notices and consent mechanisms will be added.
You are responsible for ensuring compliance with your institution's research and data handling policies when using the App for research and development purposes.

Disclaimer
The App is designed for research and development. You are not permitted to use it clinically and apply the calculation results for patient management or even treatment. The App author is not in any way responsible to any loss or damage, either to property or to human life should the App is used clinically without a written and signed consent from the author.
