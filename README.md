# Lead_cutout

App to estimate lead cutout factor based on ratio of TG-61 backscatters factor (BSF) of open cone and cutout aperture. BSF of arbitrarily-shaped lead cutout is obtained by a classic Clarkson integration scheme. Using this simple ratio of BSFs to estimate a lead cutout factor neglects the change in contribution of scatter radiation from inner wall of cone, with and without the presence of the lead cutout. Comparisons with a more robust method and/or measurements warrant more research in medical physics.

This mobile app is designed for research use (strictly not for clinical use) in the medical physics community. It is free of charge to download via Apple App Store and Google Play. There are no in-app payment and donation provisions in app. User has to accept a no-responsibility disclaimer to use app.
